This makes Workflowy behave the way I like, similar to my bullet journal setup.

### Usage:

1. Install deps `composer install`
2. Update the timezone setting in `workflowy.php`
3. Run `workflowy.php` with your login credentials: `EMAIL="x" PASSWORD="x" php workflowy.php`
4. Set a cronjob to do so at 00:00 every day
